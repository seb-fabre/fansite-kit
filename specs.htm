	<h1>Enhancements, Nice-to-have & Other ideas</h1>
	
	<h3>Favorites</h3>
	
	<p>Add an icon in the galleries toolbar. If you a logged in as a member (or an admin) you can "add a gallery to your favorites". Same thing for the photos.</p>
	<p>In the members area, (or somewhere else, maybe next to the username and logout button) an icon points to the list of your favorites.</p>
	<p>In the toolbars, add an icon to view the galleries the most added to the favorites.</p>
	
	<h3>Ratings</h3>
	
	<p>Add an icon in the toolbars, which opens a popup to rate the current gallery/photo. Ratings are 1 to 5 stars.</p>
	<p>On the page of each gallery/photo, add the average rating (stars) in the stats.</p>
	
	<h3>Themes</h3>
	
	<p>Objective: allow to change he site's colors, backgrounds and (some) layouts, such as the menu's position and direction.</p>
	<p>Technicals: big refactoring. Add a folder for each theme. In this folder, a class "Theme" (or something else) allows to overrides some existing methods, like echoHeader, echoFooter, or the function that prints the menu (the more functions the merrier). In this folder, also add a css file and an icons folder. The css file will overwrite the default rules, and the icons will be used instead of the default. You only need to add the icons you want to overwrite.</p>
	
	<h3>Carousel</h3>
	
	<p>Add a carousel on some pages where it makes sense. Home page ? News ? Gallery ? Photo preview ?</p>
	
	<h3>Tags</h3>
	
	<p>Allow to tag the galleries and the photos.</p>
	<p>In the toolbars (or somewhere else), add a link to the tag cloud (simple, text, no flash, no animation).</p>
	
	<h3>Comments</h3>
	
	<p>Allow the logged members to post comments on the galleries and the photos.</p>
	<p>In the admin area, in the comments page, add a section for the galleries comments and one for the photos comments. Allow to edit or delete them.</p>
